        We are asking you to participate in a research study. This form is designed to give you information about this study.  We will describe this study to you and answer any of your questions.<br />

        Project Title: 		Testing Negotiation Agent performance against human participants.<br />
        <br />
        Principal Investigator:	Eden Erez<br />
        Department: Computer Science / Bar Ilan University<br />
        Contact Information: edenerez@gmail.com<br />
        <br />
        The purpose of this research is to test Negotiation Agent performance against human participants and compare it to other experiments or different agents.<br />
        <br />
        We will ask you to negotiate using a web interface and achieve the best agreement you can. This will take about 30 minutes of your time.<br />
        <br />
        We do not anticipate any risks from participating in this research.<br />
        <br />
        We hope to learn more about how Computer agents manage against human opponents.<br />
        <br />
        All of the negotiation decisions and user interactions will be saved for future research.<br />
        <br />
        We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet.<br />
        <br />
        Your involvement is voluntary and you may refuse to participate before the study begins, discontinue at any time, or skip any questions/procedures that may make you feel uncomfortable, with no penalty to you, and no effect on the compensation earned before withdrawing, or their academic standing, record, or relationship with the university or other organization or service that may be involved with the research.<br />
        <br />
        The main researcher conducting this study is Eden Erez, a graduate student at Bar Ilan University. Please ask any questions you have by email. If you have questions later, you may contact Eden Erez at edenerez@gmail.com.  <br />
        If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study, you may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human Participants at 607-255-6182 or access their website at http://www.irb.cornell.edu. <br />
        You may also report your concerns or complaints anonymously through Ethicspoint online at www.hotline.cornell.edu or by calling toll free at 1-866-293-3077. Ethicspoint is an independent organization that serves as a liaison between the University and the person bringing the complaint so that anonymity can be ensured.<br />
        <br />
        Starting the negotiation process counts as agreement for this form.<br />
        <br />
        This consent will be kept by the researcher for at least five years beyond the end of the study.<br />
